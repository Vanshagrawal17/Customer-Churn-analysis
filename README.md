# Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis

## **Overview**
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecommunication sector to identify key factors driving churn and provides actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. The analysis focuses on factors such as payment methods, contract types, customer tenure, and demographics.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. Investigate customer churn patterns and identify high-risk groups.
2. Analyze the impact of contract types, payment methods, and tenure on churn rates.
3. Develop actionable insights to guide strategic customer retention efforts.
4. Visualize findings for effective communication to stakeholders.

## **Data Insights**
### Key Findings:
1. **Contract Type:**
   - Month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rate (~42%).
   - Long-term contracts (1-year: ~11%, 2-year: ~3%) significantly reduce churn.

2. **Payment Methods:**
   - Electronic check users have a churn rate of ~45%, much higher than other payment methods (~15%-18%).

3. **Tenure:**
   - Customers with less than 1 year of tenure are the most likely to churn (~50%).
   - Churn rate decreases with longer tenure (>3 years: ~15%).

4. **Demographics:**
   - Senior citizens (65+) show a higher churn rate (~41%) compared to younger customers (~26%).

5. **Service Type:**
   - Fiber Optic users experience higher churn (~30%) compared to DSL users (~20%).
